Loops Programming Practice
"""

"""
Write a menu-driven program that loops until the user quits. 
The options are (G)et name, (U)ppercase, (L)owercase, (Q)uit.
The program should start by asking the user for their name before the menu, but they can (G)et a new name. 
U/L print the name in either uppercase or lowercase.
"""


"""
Print the square of numbers between a given range. 
Ask the user for a lower number and a higher number..
.. then print all of the squares of the numbers in that range (inclusive).
Error-check the second number to make sure it is higher than the first.
"""


"""
Print a "progress bar" based on a percentage (number). 
E.g. 50% would print something like: |*****-----|, 10% would print |*---------|
Modify your previous progress bar code so you can specify a width for the bar 
(if using a function, pass in the percentage and width). E.g. 50% of 18 would be:|*********---------|
